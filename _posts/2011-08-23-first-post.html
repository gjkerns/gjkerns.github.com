<h2 id="sec-1">Who </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p><a href="http://people.ysu.edu/~gkerns/">Me</a>.  I'm an associate professor of Statistics at <a href="http://web.ysu.edu/stem/math">Youngstown State University</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown,_Ohio">Youngstown, Ohio, USA</a>.  I've been using <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> for about 7 years,  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> about 3 years,  <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> about 1 year, and <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a> for less than a year.

<h2 id="sec-2">What </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>I want this blog to be about statistics, plain and sample. No frills, no tomfoolery, just bare-boned statistics from beginning to end.  Plus Emacs, ESS, Org-Mode, and R, but that goes without saying.

<h2 id="sec-3">When </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>I've wanted to do this for a long time, but had as of yet convinced myself that I didn't have time for it.  A sabbatical coupled with the renewed energy of a <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/statsdept/user-2011/">use R! conference</a> can change things considerably.

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Emacs + Org mode + Jekyll + Github = Blog + R! </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>After much fiddling and googling I have managed to figure out how to run a blog entirely through Emacs and Git.  If you'd like to do the same I recommend reading <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html">here</a> and <a href="http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/">here</a>, with liberal doses of <a href="http://blog.envylabs.com/2009/08/publishing-a-blog-with-github-pages-and-jekyll/">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">here</a>.  Ultimately, if you'd like to know how I do it then you can find the org-mode source code for this blog <a href="https://github.com/gjkerns/blog">here</a> and you can download the final result <a href="https://github.com/gjkerns/gjkerns.github.com">here</a> (which still is source code but is as close to final as possible).
</p>
<p>
The bottom line: with this setup I can effortlessly do R code like this:
</p>



<pre class="example">rnorm(10)

<pre class="example">
 [1] -0.04236358  0.35716988  1.23907504 -1.18657710  0.49881421 -0.20377296
 [7]  0.79014960 -0.36164220 -0.95558752 -0.93268082
</pre>

And can include plots like this:

<p>A plot to get things started</p>

<p>
all housed inside a simple, dynamic text file that I can edit with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and can version-control with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>.  On top of all this, I get LaTeX formatting in HTML via <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>.  Life is good.
