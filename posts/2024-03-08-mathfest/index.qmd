# The setup

# The problem


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(plotly)
mtcars$am[which(mtcars$am == 0)] <- 'Automatic'
mtcars$am[which(mtcars$am == 1)] <- 'Manual'
mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am)
fig <- plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~hp, z = ~qsec, color = ~am, colors = c('#BF382A', '#0C4B8E'))
fig <- fig %>% add_markers()
fig <- fig %>% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Weight'),
                                   yaxis = list(title = 'Gross horsepower'),
                                   zaxis = list(title = '1/4 mile time')))
fig
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Early solutions

The first early solution to the problem was... do it by hand.  I can only imagine what a nightmare that would have been trying to schedule 300 students in workshops that they wanted to see.

# The program

Here are the steps of the program.

1. Go sequentially by student.
2. Check their 1st ranked workshop. If there is still room in Workshop I, then assign the student there.
3. If there is no room in Workshop I, then check Workshop II.  If there is still room, then assign the student there.
4. If both Workshop I and II are full in their 1st choice, then go to their 2nd ranked workshop and start over.
5. Continue in this fashion until
