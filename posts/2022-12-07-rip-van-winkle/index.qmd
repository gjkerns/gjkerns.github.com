## The pandemic's over, isn't it?

I originally wanted to title this post "The Old Woman Voyage," as sort of counterpoint to the original "Maiden Voyage" in 2011, but somehow Rip Van Winkle seems more appropriate. Do you ever feel like you woke up one day to realize the world is completely different from what you thought it was? And the world is **so** different that it feels like you must have been sleeping so long that the world has passed you by? Yeah? No? Doesn't matter---that's how I feel right now.

## New world

Maybe it was the pandemic, maybe it was my kids getting older, maybe it was the post-apocalyptic landscape of that which we call academia, maybe it was all the turmoil going on all around us in the world, somehow, there is a spooky energy in the air. I blinked my eyes and now it is so much easier to **do** stuff, like write blogs, code on Github, generate `NAMESPACE`s and documentation for `R` packages.

And all of that social media I have shunned for literally a decade is bustling with activity populated by people with dynamite ideas about anything and everything, not all of which are cat pictures and what JLo happens to be eating for breakfast.

## New mission

This blog is supposed to be about statistics, plain and sample. No JLo. No cat pictures. No snarky comments about something a politician said 10 minutes ago, or lamentations about all the turmoil going on in the world. There are too many other people talking about those things everywhere else.

Maybe this isn't a new mission, but it is a renewed energy to do what I like and do best: statistics, plain and sample.
