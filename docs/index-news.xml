<h1>Rules of the game</h1>
<p>Local customs vary, but here is a general description: the 52 cards (plus 2 Jokers) of a standard deck of playing cards are well-shuffled and posted face down on a high-visibility surface (such as a wall in the local tavern).</p>
<p>Players buy tickets, as many as they want, for $1 each and fill in their names, phone numbers and the number, 1 to 54, of the card (or joker) they want flipped. Every week, one and only one ticket is drawn and the card—one of 54—is taped to a board with the corresponding number flipped over. If it’s the queen of hearts, the owner of the ticket wins the pot. If not, the money stays in the pot and the process starts all over again the next week [with the remaining unflipped cards].</p>

<h1>Notation and Assumptions</h1>
<p>Suppose there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> unflipped cards remaining on the board. Write <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20=%2054%20-%20k"> for the number of weeks that the game has been played without a winner. Suppose you buy <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> tickets to play the game. Suppose there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> tickets bought by other people also playing the game. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?J"> denote the current running jackpot carried over from last week (before any new tickets were bought this week).</p>
<p>We assume that the deck of cards was well-shuffled before being placed on the board. We also assume that the pot of tickets was well-mixed before selection of the one potential winning ticket.</p>
<p>Finally, we suppose that nobody has x-ray vision.</p>
</section>
<section id="location-of-the-queen-of-hearts" class="level1">
<h1>Location of the Queen of Hearts</h1>
<p>After <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> weeks of lost games, the Queen of Hearts is equally likely to be located at any one of the remaining <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> cards. To see why, let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> denote the random location of the Queen of Hearts. When <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k%20=%2054">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(X=x)%20=%201/54">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20=%201,2,%5Cldots,54"> since the deck was well-shuffled. Suppose in week one the chosen ticket was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_%7B1%7D">, and suppose that ticket was a loser. Given the information <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X%20%5Cneq%20x_%7B1%7D">, the conditional distribution of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is [ (X = x,,Xx_{1}) = = = ,x = 1,2,,54,x x_{1}.<br>
]</p>
<p>Continuing in this fashion, [ (X = x,,Xx_{1},,x_{m}) = = = ,x = 1,2,,54,x x_{1},,x_{m}.<br>
]</p>
</section>
<section id="probability-that-somebody-wins-this-week" class="level1">
<h1>Probability that somebody wins this week</h1>
<p>There is a 100% chance that somebody’s ticket will be selected. That ticket will have a number on it, and that number will match the random location of the Queen of Hearts a proportion <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1/k"> of the time<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cldots"> no x-ray vision, remember? That means [ () = () = .<br>
]</p>
</section>
<section id="probability-that-you-win-this-week" class="level1">
<h1>Probability that <em>you</em> win this week</h1>
<p>There are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N%20+%20n"> total tickets in the pot, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> of which with your name on it. Assuming a well-mixed pot, the probability that one of your tickets is selected is [ () = .<br>
]</p>
<p>Given that your ticket is selected, you have probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(%5Ctext%7BNumber%20matches%7D)%20=%201/k"> that your number matches. Therefore, the probability that you win is [ ()= ( ) = .<br>
]</p>
</section>
<section id="odds-against-your-winning" class="level1">
<h1>Odds against your winning</h1>
<p>If we write <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7BN%20+%20n%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D"> then [ = = . ]</p>
</section>
<section id="probability-that-the-game-lasts-this-long" class="level1">
<h1>Probability that the game lasts this long</h1>
<p>The game ends exactly when somebody wins, and we saw earlier that when there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> tickets left, the probability that somebody wins is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1/k">. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> denote the length of the game. Then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> can be any number <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1,2,%5Cldots,54">. But <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(L%20=%201)"> is [ (L = 1) = ( k) = .<br>
]</p>
<p>Now, in order for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%20=%202"> it must be that nobody wins the first week (with probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?53/54">), and then somebody wins the second week (with probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1/53">). Thus [ (L = 2) = = . ]</p>
<p>By the same reasoning, [ (L = 3) = = , ] and so forth. In other words, the outcomes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%20=%201,2,3,%5Cldots,54"> are equally likely.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, we may ask questions like, “What are the chances the game will continue until there are at most 7 cards left?” This is [ (L ) = , ] or almost a 13% chance.</p>
</section>
<section id="it-lasted-this-long-how-much-longer" class="level1">
<h1>It lasted this long, how much longer?</h1>
<p>Given that the game has lasted <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> weeks, the location of the Queen of Hearts is uniformly distributed on the remaining <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> cards, so the same argument above carries through except now our deck has only <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> cards in it. For instance, given that there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k%20=%207"> cards left, then the probability that the game keeps going until there are at most 2 cards remaining is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2/7%20%5Capprox%200.2857143">.</p>
</section>
<section id="expected-winnings" class="level1">
<h1>Expected winnings</h1>
<p>Suppose you only started playing the game this week. Denote your winnings by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?W">, where we understand that if you lose then your winnings are negative. You spent <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C$n"> on tickets, but you will have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C$(J%20+%20N%20+%20n)"> if you win. Your expected winnings are [ (W) = -n () + (J + N + n)(), ] and after plugging in the formulas from above we get [ (W) = -n ( 1 - ) + (J + N + n)( ). ]</p>
</section>
<section id="but-what-if-i-played-earlier-weeks-too" class="level1">
<h1>But what if I played earlier weeks, too?</h1>
<p>Let’s say you bought <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%5E%7B%5Cast%7D"> tickets prior to this week’s game. Then after your <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> tickets this week you’ve invested <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20+%20n%5E%7B%5Cast%7D"> total dollars in the game which you stand to lose. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%5E%7B%5Cast%7D"> is already contained in the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?J"> dollars above, because that money carries through from week to week. Your probability of winning this week doesn’t change. Your (smaller) expected winnings are [ (W) = -(n + n^{}) ( 1 - ) + (J + N + n)( ). ]</p>
</section>
<section id="expected-winnings-per-dollar" class="level1">
<h1>Expected winnings per dollar</h1>
<p>Just divide <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(W)"> by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">, or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(n%20+%20n%5E%7B%5Cast%7D)">, whatever your case may be.</p>
</section>
<section id="can-i-try-it-out" class="level1">
<h1>Can I try it out?</h1>
<p>Sure. <a href="https://github.com/gjkerns/queenOfHearts">Here is an RStudio <code>shiny</code> app</a> that calculates (almost) all of the above for assorted values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?J">.</p>

<p><img src="https://gjkerns.github.io/posts/2022-12-07-rip-van-winkle/rip.jpg" title="Depiction of Rip Van Winkle by John Quidor (1829)" class="preview-image img-fluid" alt="Gimme that hat!"> <span class="citation" data-cites="quidor1829">Quidor (1829)</span></p>
<p>I originally wanted to title this post “The Old Woman Voyage,” as sort of counterpoint to the original “Maiden Voyage” in 2011, but somehow Rip Van Winkle seems more appropriate. Do you ever feel like you woke up one day to realize the world is completely different from what you thought it was? And the world is <strong>so</strong> different that it feels like you must have been sleeping so long that the world has passed you by? Yeah? No? Doesn’t matter—that’s how I feel right now.</p>
</section>
<section id="new-world" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-world">New world</h2>
<p>Maybe it was the pandemic, maybe it was my kids getting older, maybe it was the post-apocalyptic landscape of that which we call academia, maybe it was all the turmoil going on all around us in the world, somehow, there is a spooky energy in the air. I blinked my eyes and now it is so much easier to <strong>do</strong> stuff, like write blogs, code on Github, generate <code>NAMESPACE</code>s and documentation for <code>R</code> packages.</p>
<p>And all of that social media I have shunned for literally a decade is bustling with activity populated by people with dynamite ideas about anything and everything, not all of which are cat pictures and what JLo happens to be eating for breakfast.</p>
</section>
<section id="new-mission" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-mission">New mission</h2>
<p>This blog is supposed to be about statistics, plain and sample. No JLo. No cat pictures. No snarky comments about something a politician said 10 minutes ago, or lamentations about all the turmoil going on in the world. There are too many other people talking about those things everywhere else.</p>
<p>Maybe this isn’t a new mission, but it is a renewed energy to do what I like and do best: statistics, plain and sample.</p>

<section id="who" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who">Who</h2>
<p><a href="https://gkerns.people.ysu.edu/">Me</a>. I’m an associate professor of Statistics at <a href="https://ysu.edu/">Youngstown State University</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown,_Ohio">Youngstown, Ohio, USA</a>. I’ve been using <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> for about 7 years, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> about 3 years, <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> about 1 year, and <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a> for less than a year.</p>
</section>
<section id="what" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what">What</h2>
<p>I want this blog to be about statistics, plain and sample. No frills, no tomfoolery, just bare-boned statistics from beginning to end. Plus Emacs, ESS, Org-Mode, and R, but that goes without saying.</p>
</section>
<section id="when" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when">When</h2>
<p>I’ve wanted to do this for a long time, but had as of yet convinced myself that I didn’t have time for it. A sabbatical coupled with the renewed energy of a <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/statsdept/user-2011/">use R! conference</a> can change things considerably.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-emacs-org-mode-jekyll-github-blog-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-emacs-org-mode-jekyll-github-blog-r">How: Emacs + Org mode + Jekyll + Github = Blog + R!</h2>
<p>After much fiddling and googling I have managed to figure out how to run a blog entirely through Emacs and Git. If you’d like to do the same I recommend reading <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html">here</a> and <a href="http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/">here</a>, with liberal doses of <a href="http://blog.envylabs.com/2009/08/publishing-a-blog-with-github-pages-and-jekyll/">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">that</a>. Ultimately, if you’d like to know how I do it then you can find the org-mode source code for this blog <a href="https://github.com/gjkerns/blog">here</a> and you can download the final result <a href="https://github.com/gjkerns/gjkerns.github.com">here</a> (which still is source code but is as close to final as possible).</p>
<p>The bottom line: with this setup I can effortlessly do R code like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

 [7]  0.51524809 -0.90041545  0.52012774 -0.23936052</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And can include plots like this:</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>all housed inside a simple, dynamic text file that I can edit with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and can version-control with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>. On top of all this, I get LaTeX formatting in HTML via <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>. Life is good.</p>
